    <p>Interfaces and classes used by

    <p>Definitive implementations of commonly used encoders and decoders.</p>

    <p>Codec is currently comprised of a modest set of utilities and a
    simple framework for String encoding and decoding in three categories:
    Binary Encoders, Language Encoders, and Network Encoders. </p>
